# Police LED Light Flasher Project

## Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a Police LED light flasher circuit using two 555 timer ICs. The circuit is designed to enhance visibility for law enforcement vehicles through a flashing LED pattern, replicating the effect of traditional police lights.

## Components

The following components are essential for constructing the Police LED light flasher circuit:

- **Two 555 ICs**: These integrated circuits serve as the heart of the circuit, generating timing pulses and controlling the flashing pattern of the LEDs.

- **Resistors**: 
  - Two **1M ohm resistors** are used for timing purposes.
  - Two **180-ohm resistors** limit the current flowing through the LEDs.

- **Capacitors**: 
  - A **1uF capacitor** and a **100nF capacitor** are utilized for timing and stability in the circuit.

- **LEDs**: Light-emitting diodes that produce the desired flashing effect.

- **Power Supply**: The circuit is powered by a **9V supply**.

## Additional Materials

- **Jumper wires**: For making connections between components.
- **Breadboard**: For initial circuit assembly and testing.
- **PCB board designing tools**: Software and materials for designing the printed circuit board.
- **Soldering tools**: For securing components to the PCB.
- **Copper plate**: Used for fabricating the PCB.
- **Photo paper**: For transferring the circuit design onto the copper plate.
- **FeCl3**: Ferric chloride, used for etching the PCB.
- **Thinner**: For cleaning the PCB.
- **Marker**: For correcting any missed traces on the PCB.
- **Drilling machine / Cutting machine**: For preparing the PCB.
- **Laser printer**: To print the circuit layout.
- **PC**: For design and simulation work.
- **Iron**: For transferring the printed layout onto the copper plate.

## Conclusion

This project provides about electronic circuit design, PCB fabrication, and assembly techniques. It not only enhances knowledge in electronics but also emphasizes the importance of proper design and implementation in creating functional devices.
